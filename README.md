# Non-production plugins for work with REST API Wordpress
Using jQuery.<br>

There is a reader of posts from any WP website if the REST API is opened there.
<br>Folder **/wp-reader**.

An editor of post content with REST API is located in **/wp-content/plugins/rest-post-editor** folder.

All the code, especially the js, is quite messy.
